## PCWL v0.15

Mobile-focused refresh introducing a map-first layout.

### Highlights
- Map now dominates mobile viewports with a floating drawer for player info and controls.
- Bottom drawer supports touch scrolling, overlay backdrop, and a persistent action button.
- Login/game logic resets last-known locations reliably after account switches.
- Dev tooling adds a “Clear Users” action and default dev password updated to `deve`.
